# Restricted shadow–typed path bridge

`Fibril.Cubical.Logical.ShadowTypedBridge` connects a specific declared shadow
path to `TypedPath.NeutralHasType`. The source has one declaration whose two
endpoints are references of the same logical type. `variableIndex` retains the
references' context positions; `bridgeContext` creates the corresponding
single target neutral-path declaration. The target's `NType` is an abstract
base: this interpretation does not identify its values with booleans, units,
or functions, and does not interpret the other logical operations.

`bridgeLeft` and `bridgeRight` take the corresponding source `DeclaredEndpoint`
and independently require the target bounded syntactic entailment check. They
produce target endpoint equality. The source check additionally preflights the interval, then calls the target
face check. Source acceptance therefore implies target acceptance at the same
arguments; the converse is not asserted.
`NeutralShadowWitness` selects the source abstraction `p @ i` with its two
endpoint-rule proofs, and `bridgeDeclaredPath` derives the target typing of
that nonconstant abstraction. It requires the target checks, not target typing
or equality hypotheses. It is not a translator for arbitrary `BodyEqual` or
`DeclaredShadowPath` proofs.

The tests give a quantitative `Ref Here` with an actual linear `Uses` proof,
its shadow declaration and abstraction, both endpoint conversions and the
resulting target typing. The pre-existing linear example using `If` and Boolean
literals is **not** supported: target syntax has no Boolean operations or
literal endpoints. Also unsupported are general path telescopes, logical
binders and applications, arbitrary proof congruence/transitivity, constant
abstraction translation, and dependent family translation. This is not a
resource-preservation theorem, runtime equality, or an ownership change.

The source endpoint check first admits the interval with `intervalNodes 12`
and then calls `TypedPath.boundedFaceEntails` on the same face and endpoint.
Consequently a valid source endpoint check cannot fail the bridge's target
check at those same arguments. The abstraction witness uses the same checks
at each binder face, so it cannot provide such a counterexample either. The
wrong-face negative test therefore independently constructs a valid source
endpoint at the left face and tests the target guard at the opposite face;
it does not claim that source evidence for that opposite face exists.
The wrong-index fixture supplies valid source endpoint evidence for a different
declaration and checks its rejection by the bridge.
