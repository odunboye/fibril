# Restricted shadow–typed path bridge

`Fibril.Cubical.Logical.ShadowTypedBridge` connects a specific declared shadow
path to `TypedPath.NeutralHasType`. The source has one declaration whose two
endpoints are references of the same logical type. `variableIndex` retains the
references' context positions; `bridgeContext` creates the corresponding
single target neutral-path declaration. The target's `NType` is an abstract
base: this interpretation does not identify its values with booleans, units,
or functions, and does not interpret the other logical operations.

`endpointEntailsFace` proves for every scope, face, interval, and side that
source endpoint acceptance implies target face acceptance. The proof analyzes
the interval preflight; it needs no target hypothesis or runtime assumptions.
The converse is not asserted.

`bridgeLeft` and `bridgeRight` take a source `DeclaredEndpoint` and a
side-indexed witness selecting its actual constructor, then derive the target
check. This changes their earlier signatures, which required a separate target
check. The constructor witness is necessary: if the declared endpoints are
identical, a right-constructor endpoint proof can inhabit the left endpoint
judgment even when the left face check fails, and conversely. No arbitrary
`DeclaredEndpoint` implies acceptance of a chosen side.
`NeutralShadowWitness` selects the source abstraction `p @ i` and its actual
endpoint-rule proofs; `bridgeDeclaredPath` derives both target boundary checks
from those proofs and requires no target judgments. The newer `bridgeAbstract` translates its actual boundary proofs using
`BridgeableEquality`; it is not a translator for arbitrary `BodyEqual` or
`DeclaredShadowPath` proofs.

The tests give a quantitative `Ref Here` with an actual linear `Uses` proof,
its shadow declaration and abstraction, both endpoint conversions and the
resulting target typing. The pre-existing linear example using `If` and Boolean
literals is **not** supported: target syntax has no Boolean operations or
literal endpoints. Also unsupported are general path telescopes, logical
binders and applications, general proof congruence/transitivity, constant
abstraction translation, and dependent family translation. This is not a
resource-preservation theorem, runtime equality, or an ownership change.

The source endpoint check first admits the interval with `intervalNodes 12`
and then calls `TypedPath.boundedFaceEntails` on the same face and endpoint.
Consequently a valid source endpoint check cannot fail the bridge's target
check at those same arguments. The abstraction witness uses the same checks
at each binder face, so it cannot provide such a counterexample either. The
wrong-face negative test therefore independently constructs a valid source
endpoint at the left face and tests the target guard at the opposite face;
it does not claim that source evidence for that opposite face exists.
The wrong-index fixture supplies valid source endpoint evidence for a different
declaration and checks its rejection by the bridge.


`BridgeableBody` relates arbitrary source variable positions and the one neutral
path application to target expressions. `BridgeableEquality` is indexed by the
actual source derivation, its declarations, face and terms. `bridgeEquality`
recurses through symmetry and transitivity with a reflexive side, translates
reflexivity and both declared endpoints, and handles restricted reflexivity and
restricted endpoint proofs. For restricted endpoints the certificate rechecks
the source endpoint routine at the target face: bounded entailment acceptance
is not assumed transitive. The target endpoint check then follows from
`endpointEntailsFace` as before. `bridgeAbstract` translates the supplied
boundary proofs, including these structural derivations.

The target `NeutralEqual` has neither a general transitivity constructor nor an
equality face-restriction constructor (only typing has `NFaceRestrict`). Thus
arbitrary `BodyTrans` or `BodyRestrict` cannot be translated by a direct
structural mapping without strengthening the target judgment or proving an
additional admissibility theorem. The bridge does not assume either. In
particular the implemented transitivity cases erase a reflexive side, not a
proof of general equality composition. Other source congruence constructors
are also outside the abstract variable-only target fragment.
